Projects
========

Methods for drawing down, editing and uploading data about DocumentCloud projects. A project is a group of documents.

Retrieval
---------

.. function:: client.projects.get(id=None, title=None)

   Return the project with the provided DocumentCloud identifer. You can retrieve projects using either the `id` or `title`. ::

        >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
        >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> # Fetch using the id
        >>> obj = client.projects.get(id='816')
        >>> obj
        <Project: The Ruben Salazar Files>
        >>> # Fetch using the title
        >>> obj = client.projects.get(title='The Ruben Salazar Files')
        >>> obj
        <Project: The Ruben Salazar Files>

.. function:: client.projects.get_by_id(id)

   Return the project with the provided id. Operates the same as `client.projects.get`.

.. function:: client.projects.get_by_title(title)

   Return the project with the provided title. Operates the same as `client.projects.get`.

.. function:: client.projects.all()

   Return all projects for the authorized DocumentCloud account  ::

        >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
        >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> obj_list = client.projects.all()
        >>> obj_list[0]
        <Project: Ruben Salazar>

Editing
-------

.. method:: project_obj.put()

   Save changes to a project back to DocumentCloud. You must be authorized to make these changes. Only the `title`, `source`, `document_list` attributes may be edited. ::

        >>> obj = client.projects.get('816')
        >>> obj.title = "Brand new title"
        >>> obj.put()

.. method:: project_obj.delete()

   Delete a project from DocumentCloud. You must be authorized to make these changes. ::

        >>> obj = client.projects.get('816')
        >>> obj.delete()

.. method:: project_obj.save()

    An alias for ``put`` that saves changes back to DocumentCloud.

Creation
--------

.. method:: client.projects.create(title=None,description=None, document_ids=None)

   Create a new project on DocumentCloud. You must be authorized to do this. Returns the object representing the new record you've created.

        >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
        >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> obj = client.projects.create("New project")
        >>> obj
        <Project: New project>

.. method:: client.projects.get_or_create_by_title(title=None)

   Fetch the project with provided name, or create it if it does not exist. You must be authorized to do this. Returns a tuple. An object representing the record comes first. A boolean that reports whether or not the objects was created fresh comes second. It is true when the record was created, false when it was found on the site already.

        >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
        >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> # The first time it will be created and added to documentcloud.org
        >>> obj, created = client.projects.get_or_create_by_title("New project")
        >>> obj, created
        <Project: New project>, True
        >>> # The second time it will be fetched from documentcloud.org
        >>> obj, created = client.projects.get_or_create_by_title("New project")
        >>> obj, created
        <Project: New project>, False

    A summary of the project. Can be edited and saved with a put command.

.. attribute:: project_obj.document_ids

    A list that contains the unique identifier of the documents assigned to this project. Cannot be edited. Edit the document_list instead.
