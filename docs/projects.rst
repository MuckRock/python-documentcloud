           >>> obj_list[0]
           <Project: Ruben Salazar>

   .. method:: create(title, description="", private=True, document_ids=None)

      Create a new project on DocumentCloud. You must be authorized to do this.
      Returns the object representing the new record you've created.

           >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
           >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
           >>> obj = client.projects.create("New project")
           >>> obj
           <Project: New project>

   .. method:: get(id=None, title=None)

      Return the project with the provided DocumentCloud identifer. You can
      retrieve projects using either the `id` or `title`. ::

           >>> from documentcloud import DocumentCloud
           >>> client = DocumentCloud(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
           >>> # Fetch using the id
           >>> obj = client.projects.get(id='816')
           >>> obj
           <Project: The Ruben Salazar Files>
           >>> # Fetch using the title
           >>> obj = client.projects.get(title='The Ruben Salazar Files')
           >>> obj
           <Project: The Ruben Salazar Files>

   .. method:: get_or_create_by_title(title)

      Fetch the project with provided name, or create it if it does not exist. You
      must be authorized to do this. Returns a tuple. An object representing the

   .. attribute:: title

       The name of the project. Can be edited and saved with a put command.
