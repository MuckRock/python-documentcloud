The lead developer of this project is `Ben Welsh <http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_.

But it would not be possible without:

* `The DocumentCloud team <https://www.documentcloud.org/about>`_.
* `Chris Amico <https://github.com/eyeseast>`_, `Christopher Groskopf <https://github.com/onyxfish/>`_ and `Mitchell Kotler <http://www.muckrock.com/blog/using-the-documentcloud-api/>`_, who broke ground with code that I've adapted.
* Fixes from friendly people like `Joe Germuska <https://github.com/JoeGermuska>`_, `Shane Shifflet <https://twitter.com/#!/shaneshifflett>`_ and `Adi Eyal <https://github.com/adieyal>`_.
